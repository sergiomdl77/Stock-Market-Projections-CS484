Introduction:
Investing in stocks is a decision that can affect the lives of the investors, for good or for
bad. Such a decision should be well informed in order to minimize the probabilities of financial
loss. In reality there is no exact science to predict how the stock market will react because factors
such as politics, natural catastrophes, pandemics, and wars among other global issues can greatly
and suddenly make stocks’ behavior fluctuate. In spite of the unavoidable uncertainty of the
field, the importance of the stock market in the world’s financial stage makes it necessary to
utilize any tools available to increase the probabilities of making a profit in the stocks trade. In
this project we conducted some research about how data mining has benefited stock predictions.
Furthermore, we complemented this work with empirical research that involved the
implementation of several data mining techniques in order to explore and measure their
performance in the stock market prediction challenge. Not only did we implement different
machine learning algorithms (such as K-Nearest Neighbor, Neural Network, and Decision Tree),
but we will now walk the readers though the whole data mining process. From data pre-
processing to presentation of results and conclusion. The main goal of this paper is not to
develop a groundbreaking software that surpasses the current achievements of data mining in the
financial world, but rather prove that what is being used today in the real world works as an
effective tool that can assist in producing highly probable stock market projections.
